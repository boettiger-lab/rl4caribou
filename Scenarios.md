**Equilibrium Points**
There are two equilibrium points in our system: 
+ moose-wolf system with caribou at zero (unstable for caribou)
+ moose-wolf-caribou system

two-species equilibrium: 

$$ eqM:  \frac{(d + \omega)}{(aM (u - d hM - hM \omega))} $$

$$ eqW: \frac{(u (rm - \mu))}{(aM (u - (d + \omega) hM))} - \frac{(
 u (d + \omega) rm)}{(aM^2 Km (u - (d + \omega) hM)^2)} $$

*note* $$(d hM-u+hM \omega) < 0 $$ for eqM to be positive

add notes about stability *NIKI*

three-species equilibrium: *NIKI*

**Scenario**

We are trying to assess how to get from a 2 species system to a stable 3 species system. 

Management Strategies
+ wolf cull (proportional harvest or fixed escapement harvest rules?)
+ moose cull (prop. harvest)
+ habitat restoration (longer time scale than immediate strategies above) - implemented every 10th timestep?

Implementation
+ pulsed management
+ gradual decline
+ effectiveness in short vs. long-term strategy

We are trying to maximize caribou growth rate while retaining all 3 species on the landscape and keeping costs low. 

+ budget - curriculum learning?
